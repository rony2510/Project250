To setup XAMPP visit this [xampp-setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f8N4FEQWyY) link and follow the instructions discussed in youtube video. After installing XAMPP properly,open it and start Apache, Mysql module. Now you are going to run this project locally as localhost service.

Now open your browser and browse [this](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php) link and create databases that are used in this project using [this](https://youtu.be/Ufb8KMikNF8) link. Now the databases are created.

Now download the github codes of this project and create a directory in xampp folder in C drive where the XAMPP is installed. The directory should be created inside htdocs folder.

Now open your browser and type http://localhost/(directory-inside-htdocs) . This will redirect to index.php page. Like a directory (code) inside htdocs folder then type http://localhost/code .
